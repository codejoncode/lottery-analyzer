🎯 Core Concept: Column-Based Analysis
Instead of just analyzing numbers globally, we need to track positional data - where each number appears in the draw sequence (columns 1-5 for white balls, plus Powerball).

🔍 Key Analysis Dimensions:
1. Number-Based Column Tracking
How long since each number (1-69) appeared in each column (1-5)
Skip/draw-out statistics per number per column
Statistical measures: sum, average, max, min, std dev, variance, median, mode, range
2. Pattern-Based Column Tracking
Even/Odd patterns in each column
High/Low patterns in each column
Prime/Non-prime in each column
Sum digits in each column
Consecutive numbers in each column
Last digit patterns in each column
First digit patterns in each column
Division-based patterns in each column
3. Powerball-Specific Analysis
Dedicated Powerball analysis page
Powerball scoring system (similar to main numbers)
Pattern tracking for Powerball (even/odd, high/low, etc.)
Prediction accuracy measurement
4. Advanced Visualizations
Histograms, box plots, scatter plots
Line charts, bar charts, pie charts
All statistical measures with visual representations
🏗️ Implementation Strategy
Option A: Dedicated Column Page
New comprehensive page with all column data
Filterable by groups and filters
All statistics and visualizations in one place
