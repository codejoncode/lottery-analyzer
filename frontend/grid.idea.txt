so i want 70 * 5  = 350 numbers

i want 10 grids of 35 numbers where the numbers are 5x7 rows and columns.  

I want to grid and use it as a hit box. Like once a number occurs in the last 14 draws show me the 
boxes with red to highlight a hit.  

Now it is believed with this x5   that in 14 draws we may see some columns and rows 
that have no hits. These numbers will form a group that will track to see how often 

numbers from these groups that have not hits hit.   keep a historical view on the draws out fro each row and column. 

build this and make sure   all 70 numbers are used 5 times but never on the same grid.   

this may take some math.
