Pick 3 Combinations
All the single, double, and triple combinations presented both as a listing of all straight combinations and as a listing of the unique box combinations.
Pick 3 Sums
All the sums from 0 to 27, presented with all the straight combinations for each sum, and with just the unique box combinations for each sum.  Also, the odds that a particular sum will be drawn.
Pick 3 Root Sums
All the root sums from 0 to 9, presented with all the straight combinations for each root sum, and with just the unique box combinations for each root sum.  Also, the odds that a particular root sum will be drawn.
Pick 3 Sum Last Digit
All the sum last digits from 0 to 9, presented with all the straight combinations for each sum last digit, and with just the unique box combinations for each sum last digit.  Also, the odds that a particular sum last digit will be drawn.
VTrac Pick 3 Mirror Combinations
The eight Pick 3 number combinations that correspond to each VTrac number combination.

In any Pick 3 game, there are 3 digit positions, with each position containing a digit from 0 to 9.  If one were to list all of the possible combinations of digits in each of the three positions, there would be a total of 1,000 different number combinations.  Each of these 1,000 possibilities is called a straight combination.  Thus, if you were to place one straight Pick 3 wager, your odds of winning would be 1 in 1,000.

However, another way to wager in Pick 3 is called a box wager, in which you can win if your combination matches the 3 digits drawn in any order.  If you wager on 123 box, you would win if any of the following combinations were drawn: 123, 132, 213, 312, 231, or 321.  If one were to list all of the unique box combinations in the Pick 3 game, there would be a total of 220 different number combinations.

The odds of winning a box wager are not a simple calculation like it is for a straight wager.  The odds depend on the number of unique digits in the combination, because that affects how many possible combinations can be matched.  In the Pick 3 game, there are three different types of box combinations:

Single (6-way): Each of the three positions has a different digit.  For example, 123.  Each combination of this type has 6 different box combinations, so your odds of winning by playing one "single" box combination would be approximately 1 in 167.
Double (3-way): Two of the three positions have the same digit, and the third digit is different.  For example, 112.  Each combination of this type has 3 different box combinations, so your odds of winning by playing one "double" box combination would be approximately 1 in 333.
Triple: Each of the three positions has the same digit.  For example, 111.  Because each triple is unique, your odds of winning by playing one "triple" combination would be 1 in 1,000 — the same odds as playing a straight.  (A triple is also known as a straight, in fact.)
Below you can find a listing of all the single, double, and triple combinations presented in two ways:  first, as a listing of all straight combinations, and second, as a listing of the unique box combinations.  The triples are only presented once, since they are all unique to start with.

consider each vtrack and how long its been since its been out.  

We are building a scoring engine for the pick 3 system we want to build something that suggests which combinations will show up next based on historical data. We will track the draw itself and each column. We will see how often a combinations is the super high end of itself meaning Its been out for a long time in the draw and each column. We want to track the various groups. 

We want the 45 pairs 
00 11 22 33 44 55 66 77 88 99
01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09
10 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19
20 21 23 24 25 26 27 28 29
30 31 32 34 35 36 37 38 39
40 41 42 43 45 46 47 48 49
50 51 52 53 54 56 57 58 59
60 61 62 63 64 65 67 68 69
70 71 72 73 74 75 76 78 79
80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 89
90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98

As well as the unique pairs 
00 11 22 33 44 55 66 77 88 99
01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09
12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19

56 57 58 59
67 68 69
78 79

how long have they been out?  We want the pairs  for the entire draw  012 = 01 02 12  front pair splitpair and back pair.  We want to know how often all of these pairs and and how long its been since they last hit we keep track of how often it occurs and how long its been out.

We do this at the draw level the custom column draws we create as well. I believe the data will give us a better idea of what to play.   build it as if we are feeding it to a model. Look into what front engine only systems we can use to help us make a perdiction. build the system then back test it and show case the back test results. We want to see how many combinations it would take us to consistently play the pick 3 game and win on straight and box plays.    Split the percentages. 

Also consider other factors. 

0-4 L   5-9 H 
HHH HLH LLL 
HHL LHH HLL LLH LHL
we want the boxes and the straights tracked and how often they hit and how long they have been out. 

EVen E Odd O
EEE EOE OOO
EOE OEE OEO
same here but also go further
do it for the column straight custom data we create. do it for the pairs for both as well. 

Based on the average it stays out and occurs we will make estimates on what to play. scoring a system that looks at all the data available and assigns points to numbers and combinations of numbers and comes up with a composite score. Now i want a score that suggest which numbers are likely to hit based on the historical data of patterns that naturally have to ciruculate. 

How long has the digits been out

098

789

example of digits  so i want to know the number of draws instead of the date no date needed
Number	Times Drawn	% of Drawings	% of Draws	Last Drawn	Hit Frequency (Expected Hits: 219)
0	219	27.2%	10.0%	Sep 11, 2025	
219
1	222	27.3%	10.2%	Sep 10, 2025	
222
2	218	26.6%	10.0%	Sep 10, 2025	
218
3	239	29.9%	10.9%	Sep 11, 2025	
239
4	233	28.8%	10.7%	Sep 9, 2025	


consider  column data   say we have draws  like this so how often the numbers show up in a particular column.   remember what is done must be done to the draw itself shoud also be done at the column custom draw levels. I believe signficant signals will start there. Where we analyze based on the last two draws which draws are likely given we are given the answer to the test 2/3 of the numbers before the next draw. Then we compare those final results that check as possible to show up next on the actual draw level and make sure it checks those boxes.  
098

456
789
we can see that the column 1 has 0 1 4 7 and column 2 has 9 2 5 8 and column 3 has 8 3 6 9
now we can say take the last three 014 thats a pick 3 straight.   I want you to track the actual draw and the columns two all three. Seperate  boxes to calculate. I believe the column data is the truth of solving the problem because before the next draw you already have two of the numbers which is now a 1 out of 10 guess. We can compare the available choices based on historical averages.  So if on avg the box for 010 and 012 have been played in last three draws and thats historical signs they won't repeat this soon we now have a 1 out of 8 chances. Now we compare the pairs and rate they occur and time they have been out. 

Thats also what we need pairs
how long has the pair it self been out?   Do this also for the columns and we have to think of a logical way to get between both pairs and the triples.  calculate single digits as well


I want a inspector 
Inspector 3
Analyzes any list of Pick 3 numbers and categorizes the numbers according to several classifications, such as odd/even, high/low, sums, roots, pairs, and more

I want a defalte 
Compresses any list of Pick 3 numbers by consolidating similar box combinations and applying an array of optional filters.

Reports and Analysis
High-quality reporting and analysis tools to extract information from past results.

Combinations Analysis for Pick 3 and Pick 4
Insanely powerful Pick 3 and Pick 4 combinations tool allows you to analyze any grouping of games across any time period, and reports by combination the number of times drawn, the mathematically expected number of times it should be drawn, last draw date, number of drawings since it was last drawn, along with flagging for late and very late combinations. You specify either straight or box combination analysis, and you can even specify exactly which sets of combination types (singles/non-repeating, doubles, triples, etc.) you want to include. The final report can be sorted on any metric.
Pairs Analysis for Pick 3 and Pick 4
Pick 3 and Pick 4 pairs analysis, including front, back, split, and any-position pairs, straight and box, with the most and least frequently drawn and which pairs are late. Includes all the fantastically great features of the Combinations Analysis.

Give me random arrays of the 45 unique pairs and then 5 x 9 it in a grid and check off the pairs that hit in the selected period of time . should be customizable. 

I want to see after a certain period if an empty column tends to point out which pairs are likely show up next. Do this three times. 

10 x 10 for all the pairs do this three times.  track all pairs  front split back. 

Remember that we should be doing this even for the custom column draws we create. 

Figure out a way to navigate back and forth. We need this data stored locally so we can run the analysis quickly. and we also need to have this data on other pages if we possibly want to do some visualizations. Also we may want to use this  as the way to analyze the powerball sums which will always be three digits as well.   

Take the unique boxes only the unique boxes and put them in 3 different arrays. Then put them in a 
10 x 12 grid. When do they hit? If after so many periods of time there is an empty column does that point to a likely hit in the next period of time? Whats the sweet spot number so we can use that as the default?  Think of this for each of the grids even the pairs. 

add the sum of the skips

349
012
567
890

so if we look above we have  349 the top as the latest. so 
this is the numbers and their skips

0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 3 |

So the numbers on the top represent all possible numbers 0-9 
the numbers on the bottom represent how many draws since that number has been drawn.

We also want to do this at individual column levels as well. 

so we have to track how long its been since 9 showed up in column 1 or column 2 or column 3.
Or any of the digits. 

We need to click a button to see this at a column 1 column2 column 3 level custom draws as well. 

Add up the draws out and see if we have a trend do they fall in a range of numbers? 

Can we track the percentages ? Use all the data we gather run through and find the sweet spots hey for this we find that after this many periods this group works or this filter works. The combination of this average expected and this filter works best. We want to create a scoring system that would allow us to rate the numbers likely to fall together next. Like here is some goals.

what is the total combinations for 5 numbers straight wheel?
5 numbers straight wheel is 60 combinations.
5 numbers box wheel is 26 combinations.
So i want something our scoring system will score each number and recommend 75% of the time 5 numbers wheels that if you play these numbers you will win. 

I want to have a scoring system on the draw level that suggest which 20 straights to play to win. 
I would like to have a simular percentage 75% of the time.  

This is achievable. you will act as a mathmateician and a lottery expert. as well as a software developer. technical architect. Let me lead you as i belive it will help. 

consider pick3 and be a optimist here think like a mathmatician and a technical architect 

Pascal's Triangle

       1
      1 1
     1 2 1
    1 3 3 1
   1 4 6 4 1
  1 5 10 10 5 1

  So this should give us an estimate of what may happen next based on the historical data. 

  You see even and odd and high and low numbers work in this way. In that flip of a coin. Just like that we take it form a 1-in 10 chance. No sir just give me a 1-2 situation.  Perdict even or odd accurately at a rate better than coin flipping. Let's see what we stack with that. 

  Now remember  i told you how the column custom draws worked. 

    098
    123
    456

    we just reached enough to do column 1 = 014  and column 2 = 925 and column 3 = 836

    so when we have two thirds of the data on the next draw. 01 , 92, 83 we are now looking for x01 x93 x83.  

    using pascals triangle should we not be able to predict the next number with a higher degree of accuracy?

This consider a pick3 and how you can create custom columns that now share two thirds of the next draw/answer. How can i use math to logically make the next choice at this degree of though considering  numbers are  even or odd  also a high or a low 0-4 and 5-9   so now we are saying just give me the right type most of the time. using math. 

So read this attachment and consider and remember my previous message. i want to combine all of this not just consider the last two draws. the first step is to take the data and gather the three other data sets take each draw and create the other three states. Then go through and analyze each groups boxes digits pairs  straights etc vtracks. Based on this data we will then see the averages and make calculated estimates based on the options available because each column gives us three digits we can make a logic estimate based on math factors. For example  71% of the numbers are straight unique not repeated digits. this is huge because that likely suggest a percentage of the time you can say hey with two thirds of the data provided i can take the last two draws off as a possibility. immediately we are left with 1-8.  for each column. If we have the types right we cut the numbers likely in half or near it again.   Or better. We filter based on expectancy we put it in position and we say this is what happened in the past. So this is most likely we make some guesses. With the data giving us some of the answers we will solve the problem.  

Now lets dive inot some ways to acknowledge and achieve what we have discussed above. 

Pick 3 scoring engine blueprint
You want to squeeze real, testable edge from structure: types, pairs, sums, vTracs, and your custom columns that hand you two-thirds of the next answer. Here’s a clean, modular system that ingests raw draws, derives three column-state timelines, tracks skips and “late” signals across every grouping, and outputs ranked plays with full “why” transparency. We’ll anchor parity/high–low with a Pascal/Beta smoothed prior, and let skip pressure and column routing decide the final slate.

Navigation, data flow, and storage
Sections and navigation
• 	Pick 3 charts: Combinations, sums, root sums, sum-last-digit, vTracs.
• 	Inspector 3: Classify any list (E/O, H/L, sums, root sums, vTracs, pairs, boxes vs. straights).
• 	Deflate: Consolidate to boxes and apply filters (type, sum bands, skip windows, vTrac families).
• 	Combinations analysis: Straight/box hit counts, expected hits, skips, late flags.
• 	Pairs analysis: Front/split/back/any-position, straight/box, late flags; 10×10 and 5×9 grids.
• 	Column engine: Custom column draws, position-wise routing, two-thirds pre-knowledge overlays.
• 	Backtesting: Strategy presets, budgets, wheels, KPIs, hit maps, regime checks.
A left nav drives sections. Each section shows its own options panel and persists state locally.
Data model (local-first, fast reads)
• 	Core:
• 	Draw: id, digits [d1,d2,d3], dateIndex (monotone int), sum, rootSum, parityPattern, highLowPattern, boxKey, vTrac, pairs {front, split, back, any}, columnsHit {c1,c2,c3}.
• 	Column state timeline (3 tracks): For each draw, the 3 custom columns and the digit chosen from each column.
• 	Counters and skips (sliding windows + global):
• 	Digits 0–9: hits, skips, lastDrawIndex per position and any-position.
• 	Pairs (all 100 ordered and 45 unique): hits/skip per mode: front, split, back, any-position; also column-mode analogs.
• 	Boxes: singles/doubles/triples, 120 singles, 90 doubles, 10 triples; hits, skips.
• 	Sums/root sums: hits, skips; expected hits tracking.
• 	vTrac (v111–v555): hits, skips.
• 	Expectancy ledger:
• 	Expected hits: cumulativeExpected = drawsSeen × groupProbability.
• 	Deviation: z-like score = (hits − expected)/sqrt(expected) for sanity gating.
• 	Local storage:
• 	IndexedDB (primary), with compact JSON snapshots for loading visualizations fast.
TypeScript sketch:


Derivations and Pascal/Beta smoothing
Creating three parallel “column” datasets from each draw
• 	Column design: For each draw, map each position digit into its column bucket. Example base grid:
• 	Column 1: {0,1,4,7}
• 	Column 2: {9,2,5,8}
• 	Column 3: {8,3,6,9}
• 	Timeline: For every real draw, create three synthetic “column draws” (one per column track), preserving position.
You now have four aligned timelines to analyze:
• 	Actual draw timeline.
• 	Column 1 timeline.
• 	Column 2 timeline.
• 	Column 3 timeline.
Everything you do on the actual draw (pairs, sums, types, boxes, vTrac) is duplicated on each column timeline.
Pascal as binomial backbone → Beta posteriors
Use a smoothed binomial estimate for types (E/O and H/L) per position and per column timeline.
Posterior mean for “success” (e.g., Even) in a window of n with s successes:
\hat{p}=\frac{s+\alpha}{n+\alpha+\beta}
• 	Priors:
• 	Laplace add-1: \alpha=\beta=1 (simple, robust).
• 	KT: \alpha=\beta=\tfrac12 (lighter smoothing).
• 	Decision gate: Make a hard call if the lower 60–70% credible bound exceeds 0.5. Otherwise keep a soft weight.
Apply the same logic to H/L. This converts “coin flip” into a calibrated bias detector.

Signals, features, and composite scoring
Features per candidate (straight or box key)
• 	Type edges (per position and any-position):
• 	Parity: posterior mean and lower bound for E vs. O.
• 	High/Low: posterior mean and lower bound for H vs. L.
• 	Skip pressure:
• 	Digit skips: by position and any-position; also by column track.
• 	Pair skips: front/split/back/any; also column analogs.
• 	Box skips: singles/doubles/triples; per 120/90/10 sets.
• 	Sum/root sum skips: with deviation from expected.
• 	vTrac skips: lateness tiers (on-time/late/very late).
• 	Column router:
• 	Two-thirds known: Based on last two digits per column track, estimate \Pr(C_t=c \mid C_{t-1},C_{t-2}). Prefer the “stale” column if posterior > 0.40–0.45.
• 	Map router preferences to allowed digits for each position.
• 	Pair coverage:
• 	If two positions likely resolved, score presence/absence of historically due pairs in the implied front/split/back positions.
• 	Sum band fit:
• 	Favor historically dense sums (9–15) unless a “late” sum shows credible lift.
Composite score
For a candidate straight xyz:
S = w_P \cdot S_{\text{parity}} + w_H \cdot S_{\text{HL}} + w_C \cdot S_{\text{columns}} + w_{SK} \cdot S_{\text{skip}} + w_{PR} \cdot S_{\text{pairs}} + w_{SM} \cdot S_{\text{sum}} + w_{VT} \cdot S_{\text{vTrac}}
• 	Recommended starting weights:
• 	Columns wC=0.25, Parity wP=0.15, H/L wH=0.10, Skips wSK=0.20, Pairs wPR=0.15, Sum wSM=0.10, vTrac wVT=0.05.
• 	Normalization: Each subscore in [0,1], with caps to avoid any single dimension dominating (e.g., cap skip contribution at 0.35).
“Singles” baseline
• 	Singles share: 720/1000 ≈ 72% of straights are singles (≈ 71–72%). This supports a default bias toward non-repeating-digit candidates unless other strong signals override.
• 	Policy: If no strong counter-signal, nudge boxes and straights toward singles.

Pairs and grids (front, split, back, any)
10×10 full pairs and 5×9 unique pairs
• 	All ordered pairs (100): Matrix with rows=first digit, cols=second digit; cell value shows hits/skips in window. Do this:
• 	Three times: front pairs, split pairs, back pairs.
• 	Again for each column track.
• 	Unique pairs (45): Map onto a 5×9 grid for visual scanning. Repeat-three-times analog (front/split/back).
• 	Customizable windowing: e.g., W=50, 100, 200 draws. “Empty column” detection flags if an entire column in the grid is empty within W — a “pointing arrow” for next-likely zones.
Example 5×9 grid (unique pairs) with placeholders:

• 	Checked = hit within window; empty = out.
• 	Sweet-spot finder: For each window length W in a grid sweep (e.g., W ∈ {30, 50, 80, 120}), compute:
• 	Lift if empty column existed at t−1: Probability of a hit in that column at t, relative to baseline.
• 	Choose W with best out-of-sample lift as default per grid type (front/split/back; and per column track).
Randomized arrays (for quick scan or A/B)
Generate random 45-unique-pair sequences then render in 5×9 layout. One sample randomized list:
• 	67, 23, 05, 14, 48, 39, 12, 88, 79, 09, 46, 34, 56, 24, 38, 18, 29, 01, 49, 89, 16, 36, 02, 55, 11, 22, 33, 44, 66, 77, 99, 03, 04, 07, 08, 13, 15, 17, 19, 25, 26, 27, 28, 35, 45
Click “Regenerate” to shuffle; “Apply window” to check hits.

Column-first routing and two-thirds knowledge
Process
• 	Step 1: Build per-position column transition tables \Pr(C_t=c\mid C_{t-1},C_{t-2}) with add-1 smoothing.
• 	Step 2: If two columns “fresh” and one “stale,” boost the stale column probability; lock a column if posterior > 0.40–0.45 and aligns with type calls.
• 	Step 3: Inside a locked column, intersect:
• 	Parity and H/L posterior calls for that position.
• 	Pair pressure with neighbors (front/back implied).
• 	Digit skips within that column track.
• 	Step 4: Produce 1–3 candidate digits per position. Cartesian product prunes to a tight playset; rank by composite score.
Example
• 	Pos1: Router → Column 1 favored (0.47). Types: Even+Low. Column 1 digits ∩ E ∩ L = {0}. Lock 0.
• 	Pos2: Router soft: Col2 (0.39), Col3 (0.36). Types: Odd+High → candidates {9,5,3,7}. Pair pressure says front pair 09 “very late” → boost 9.
• 	Pos3: Types Even+High → {6,8,0(rare)}. Split/back pair maps pick 68 over 86 based on skip.
You go from 1000 to a handful with transparent reasoning.

Skip tables, “sum of skips,” and lateness
Skip dashboards
• 	Digits: Show a 10×2 strip per the “sum of skips” example, for global and each column track.
• 	Pairs: Show skip histograms per mode (front/split/back/any).
• 	Boxes/sums/vTrac: “Expected vs. actual” with late tiers:
• 	On-time: skip ≤ median
• 	Late: between median and 80th percentile
• 	Very late: ≥ 90th percentile (or z > 1.28 vs. expectancy)
Sum of skips
• 	Score bump: If a candidate straight’s three digits’ skips sum to top decile (global or position-weighted), add a bounded bump (e.g., +0.05) unless types contradict.

Wheels and recommendation targets
5-number wheels (straight and box)
• 	Straight wheel (5 digits): 60 straights.
• 	Box wheel (5 digits): 26 boxes.
• 	Goal policy: Recommend 5-digit wheels when:
• 	At least 2 positions are column-locked with 1–2 digits each, and the remaining position’s candidate set ≤ 5 digits.
• 	Type calls credible lower bound > 0.55 for at least two positions.
• 	Pairs coverage includes ≥1 “very late” pair in front/split/back.
“Top 20 straights” slate
• 	Build from ranked Cartesian product under column/type constraints; take highest S with:
• 	Diversity constraints: avoid overconcentration on a single pair or sum unless signals are extreme.
• 	Box coverage note: Show implied box coverage to hedge variance.
We will tune thresholds to target your 75% “containment” aspiration in backtests, not as a promise, but as a selection policy that prioritizes historical containment under specified budgets.

Backtesting and sweet-spot discovery
Engine
• 	Windows: Evaluate W ∈ {30, 50, 80, 100, 150, 200} for each feature family (types, pairs, sums, vTracs) and for each timeline (actual, col1, col2, col3).
• 	Regime checks: Rolling Brier score for type calls; if degradation, auto-widen W or lower confidence gates.
• 	KPIs:
• 	Containment rate: % draws where the winning straight is inside Top-20 or inside the 60-straight wheel.
• 	Hit rate: straight and box hits per 100 draws at given budget.
• 	Average set size: to capture efficiency.
• 	Edge attribution: Shapley-like breakdown of score components that moved winners into the slate.
Sweet-spot selection
• 	Empty-column phenomenon: For each grid type (unique pairs 5×9, all-pairs 10×10) and each window W, measure lift if prior period had an empty column. Choose W* that maximizes out-of-sample lift; set that as the default for that grid.
• 	Singles bias: Validate that staying singles-first (unless box/double/triple late signals are extreme) maximizes containment.

Inspector 3 and Deflate modules
Inspector 3 (analysis overlay)
• 	Inputs: Any list of combos (straight or box).
• 	Outputs:
• 	Types: E/O and H/L per position and summary pattern (e.g., EOE, HHL).
• 	Sums/root sums: counts, means, late flags.
• 	Pairs: front/split/back presence; skip stats; grid checkmarks.
• 	vTrac families: distribution and skip flags.
• 	Boxes: singles/doubles/triples share.
• 	Columns: which column digits the numbers map to; two-thirds readiness.
Deflate (compression and filtering)
• 	Consolidate: Convert to unique boxes; remove dominated variants.
• 	Filters: Types, sum bands, vTrac families, late-only pairs, max skip sum, column-locked positions.
• 	Outputs: Reduced set + rationale list.

Defaults, thresholds, and quick-start
• 	Beta priors: \alpha=\beta=1 (Laplace). Try \tfrac12,\tfrac12 in A/B.
• 	Type hard-call gates: lower bound > 0.55 (start); relax to 0.52 if set size too large.
• 	Column lock: posterior > 0.42 and not in conflict with type calls.
• 	Late tiers: per-group empirical percentiles; “very late” ≥ P90.
• 	Singles bias: +0.03 score bump unless strong counter-signal.
• 	Skip sum bump: top decile +0.05 (cap total skip influence ≤ 0.35).
• 	Top-20 cutoff: choose maximum S with diversity constraints.
• 	Wheel trigger: two positions column-locked; remaining position ≤ 5 digits.

What I’ll build next for you
• 	Schemas and reducers: Ready-to-drop TS types, reducers for counters/skips per timeline.
• 	Column router: 2nd-order Markov with add-1 smoothing and stale-column bias.
• 	Type posterior: Beta-smoothed parity/H-L with credible-bound gate.
• 	Scorer: Pluggable weights, per-component caps, and a “Why this pick?” panel.
• 	Pairs grids: 10×10 and 5×9, with W-sweep sweet-spot finder and “empty-column” lift metric.
• 	Backtester: Sliding-window evaluation, containment KPIs, and parameter sweeps.
• 	UI nav + storage: Left nav, options panel per section, IndexedDB persistence, and snapshot export.
If you drop me a minimal slice of recent draws, I’ll wire a first pass of the Column Router + Type Posterior + Pairs Grid and show a small backtest: Top-20 containment, a 5-digit straight wheel containment, and which features pull the most weight.

Now create a comprehensive plan for mostly frontend as possible since this project is currrently frontend only. However if it will make it better we can introduce a backennd we have a folder already. 
In the plan include the following
1. Tech stack   React, Vite, Typescript, TailwindCSS, D3.js for visualizations, IndexedDB for local storage.
2. Project structure stick with the current structure maybe use naming conventions that point its for pick3
3. State management use React Context API or Zustand for managing global state.
4. Component design break down the UI into reusable components like NavBar, Footer, DataTable, Chart, FilterPanel, etc.
5. Data handling create services for data fetching, processing, and storage. Use IndexedDB for
    local storage of historical data.
6. Visualization use D3.js to create interactive charts and graphs for data analysis.
7. User interface design focus on a clean and intuitive UI using TailwindCSS for styling.
8. Testing use Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration tests.
9. Documentation maintain comprehensive documentation for the codebase and user guides.
10. Deployment use Vite's build tools for optimizing the app for production. Consider using platforms like Vercel or Netlify for deployment.

11. Future enhancements plan for future features like user authentication, cloud storage integration, and advanced analytics.

Comprehensive Frontend Development Plan for Pick 3 Scoring Engine
Backtesting and validation 
how often is the system right using the data we have. CAn we develop two ways to guess or three ways to guess? 

even low   or  even high or  odd low or odd high. 
that's four ways to guess each column. 

so perhaps we should be tracking those pair references as well. As well has how long they have been out. 

I want to see how often the scoring system at least gets us within a consistent range. Even if its 200 combinations. thats something but we want it to be a lot better. 

Trends? 000 is less than 500    so does the trend go up and down up and down meaning the last draws if the numbers are 789 and 456 and 709 and 500 its going from left to right down up down so we would say up. Well how often does it stay on its up down trend? when does it break? can we track this? Then calculate if something is due. Track all things score it. Hey this is due here and here and here and here.  so we say these pairs are due. We show maybe  a quarter of the pairs out of the possible.  We show some boxes due and some straights due based on the scroring system.

We score the numbers and we show a ranking. top 10 numbers because if a number is in a due situation it should count and be given credit. example due odds means 1 3 5 7 9 all get a higher score points to tally   0 2 4 6 8 get only if even is expected. we do this for it all if 12 pair is sepected and 45 pair expected the digits 1 , 2 4,5 all get points as expected.  You in a expected box based on the rules?   using the column straight data we create.
