🎯 README: ApexScoop Lottery Prediction System
Purpose: Engineer a teachable, auditable, and scalable frontend system to predict Powerball combinations using partial certainty, recurrence logic, draw location analysis, and statistical expectancy.

🧠 Strategic Summary
We treat lottery prediction as a solvable problem by:
• 	Solving smaller subproblems (e.g., predicting 3 of 5 balls)
• 	Using filters, averages, and recurrence logic to reduce the search space
• 	Tracking draw “locations,” sum trends, and hot/cold zones to narrow prediction pools
• 	Scoring combinations based on recurrence, skip, pair/triple logic, and draw behavior
• 	Caching and visualizing predictions to avoid recomputation and enable teachable overlays
This system doesn’t chase luck — it builds leverage by engineering clarity, traceability, and modular certainty.
We use TypeScript + React to build a performant, interactive frontend that runs smoothly on an 8GB laptop.

🧩 Core Modules to Implement


🛠️ Implementation Steps (Frontend-First)
1. Data Setup
• 	✅ Load historical Powerball draws into local JSON or SQLite (draw date, numbers, bonus, sum)
• 	✅ Precompute draw index (e.g., Draw #25909 to #56789), sum, and recurrence metadata
• 	✅ Cache all combinations and their metadata (sum, parity, recurrence, hot/cold status)
2. Filter Engine
• 	🔧 Build UI controls for:
• 	Sum range (slider)
• 	Odd/even balance
• 	High/low split
• 	First ball digit (e.g., single-digit)
• 	Skip count thresholds
• 	🔄 Apply filters to reduce candidate pool dynamically
3. Hot/Cold Analysis
• 	🔥 Track:
• 	Frequency of each ball over rolling windows
• 	Skip count since last appearance
• 	Heat score based on recent activity
• 	📊 Visualize with:
• 	Color-coded heatmaps
• 	Hot/cold/warm zones
• 	Recurrence timelines
4. Draw Location Analysis
• 	📈 Calculate:
• 	Draw index range (e.g., 25909–56789)
• 	Average jump between draws
• 	Over/under average behavior
• 	🧭 Predict next draw zone:
• 	If last jump was +120, expect -80 or +60 next
• 	Use this to constrain sum range and combo pool
5. Combo Scoring
• 	🧠 Composite score = weighted sum of:
• 	Ball recurrence
• 	Pair/triple recurrence
• 	Skip count alignment
• 	Sum proximity to predicted zone
• 	Hot/cold status
• 	🧮 Rank combos and display score breakdown
6. Backtesting Engine
• 	🧪 For each draw:
• 	Compare predicted combos to actual draw
• 	Track hit rates: 1-0, 2-0, 3-0, 4-0, 5-0
• 	📊 Display accuracy over time:
• 	Line chart of hit rates
• 	Table of top-performing filters
7. Caching & Optimization
• 	🧱 Store:
• 	Scored combos
• 	Filter states
• 	Draw metadata
• 	🧠 Avoid recomputation by caching results
• 	🧮 Optimize coverage:
• 	Select top N combos based on score
• 	Apply budget constraints (e.g., $20 = 10 combos)

🧪 Sample Backtest Targets

Track how often each pool hits 1–5 correct numbers. Use this to refine filters and scoring logic.

🧭 Final Notes
• 	This system is frontend-heavy, built in TypeScript + React, and optimized for local execution.
• 	Backend optional — only needed for large-scale ingestion or cloud caching.
• 	Every module should be modular, teachable, and auditable.
• 	You’re not just predicting — you’re building a learning engine that evolves with each draw.
