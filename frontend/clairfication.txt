so we should get clairfication on the category identification 

for example  the digits  I want to know the following how many hit from the cold/even/due vs the hot/over for each
last digit how many were coldeven  show the category name and the amount of cold vs hot that hit 
do this under each category please so each section should have its own section to analyze. 

do it right underneath the count section. Also add a column i want to know how long its been since its been draw. So all the numbers in that section would
be tracked. 

do this for me please
