# Powerball Scoring & Prediction System - Implementation Roadmap

## 📊 Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation of a scoring and prediction system for the Powerball lottery analyzer. The system will transform existing filters, averages, and draw counts into a predictive scoring engine that helps identify patterns and make data-driven predictions for future draws.

## 🎯 Core Objectives

1. **Scoring System**: Create a multi-factor scoring system based on dues, evens, colds, and overs/hots
2. **Prediction Engine**: Use data science techniques to predict future draw outcomes
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring patterns in number combinations and sums
4. **User Interface**: Provide intuitive visualization of scores and predictions
5. **Validation**: Implement comprehensive testing to ensure accuracy

## 🏆 Scoring System Methodology

### 1. Dues Scoring (Draws Since Last Appearance)
```javascript
// Points based on how long since number last appeared
if (drawsSinceLastDrawn <= 5) score += 1;      // Recently drawn
else if (drawsSinceLastDrawn <= 10) score += 2; // Moderately due
else score += 3;                               // Very due
```

### 2. Evens Scoring (Even Number Distribution)
```javascript
// Points based on even numbers in combination
score += evenCount; // 0-5 points based on even numbers present
```

### 3. Colds Scoring (Cold Number Analysis)
```javascript
// Points based on cold number patterns
if (drawsSinceLastDrawn <= 5) score += 1;      // Still warm
else if (drawsSinceLastDrawn <= 10) score += 2; // Getting cold
else score += 3;                               // Very cold
```

### 4. Overs/Hots Scoring (Hot Number Analysis)
```javascript
// Points based on hot/overperforming numbers
score += oversHotsCount; // 0-5 points based on hot numbers present
```

### Total Score Calculation:
```javascript
function calculateScore(numberData) {
    let score = 0;

    // Dues component
    if (numberData.drawsSinceLastDrawn <= 5) score += 1;
    else if (numberData.drawsSinceLastDrawn <= 10) score += 2;
    else score += 3;

    // Evens component
    score += numberData.evenCount;

    // Colds component (same as dues for now, can be refined)
    if (numberData.drawsSinceLastDrawn <= 5) score += 1;
    else if (numberData.drawsSinceLastDrawn <= 10) score += 2;
    else score += 3;

    // Overs/Hots component
    score += numberData.oversHotsCount;

    return score;
}
```

## 📈 Prediction & Pattern Analysis

### Sum Prediction Strategy

**Key Insight**: Most Powerball sums fall between 100-300, with first digit typically 1 or 2
- This reduces prediction space from 1:1000 to 1:100
- Sum becomes a powerful filtering mechanism

#### Sum Analysis Components:
1. **Historical Sum Tracking**: Monitor sum patterns over time
2. **Due Sum Analysis**: How long since specific sum last appeared
3. **Trend Analysis**: Up/down patterns in sum values
4. **Range Prediction**: Predict likely sum ranges for next draw

### Pattern Recognition Goals:
- Identify recurring number combinations
- Detect sum patterns and cycles
- Predict hot/cold number transitions
- Analyze even/odd distribution trends
